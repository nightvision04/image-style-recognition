# image-style-recognition

This project uses a scikit pipeline to predict and sort the quality of photos across several metrics, such as:

- Filmic color style
- Modern color style
- Framing style
- Texture and interest
- Geometric interest

It has the ability to detect professional photos with a tolerance of 3-5% and provides a granular score between 0.01 and 1.00 to the user with a variety of sorting options. It is particularily useful for projects who may wish to algorithmically:

- Reject Amatuer Images
- Prioritize Inspiring Images
- Optimize Viewer Engagement
- Optimize Brand Image
- Automatically Promote Attractive Content

# Dependencies

- Python 3.6 (Anaconda)

 # Machine Learning Pipeline

 The pipeline currently combines several nodes of Principal Component Analysis, and Random Forest classifiers in a convolution design to traverse image data. This allows for the model to stay flexible when handling unique image shapes.

Training data is currently around 90,000 samples and applies a broad variance.
