# image-style-recognition
This project uses a scikit pipeline to predict and sort the quality of photos across several metrics, such as:

- filmic color style
- modern color style
- framing style
- texture and interest
- geometric interest

Here are some screenshots.

The site is also customized for a special mobile experience that lets the user quickly curate pictures from their camera.

 Currently the project is in alpha, but the main engine is complete.

 # Machine Learning Pipeline
 
 The pipeline currently combines several nodes of Principal Component Analysis, and Random Forest classifiers in a convoultion design to 'wipe' across images. This allows for the model to handle unique image shapes.
